trackerSpend
=============

The aim of trackerSpend is two-fold:

- Help me to understand, plan and forecast my finances.
- Allow me to experiement with different technologies and development strategies in an environment where, so long as I'm learning, no time can be wasted.

Approach
--------
For the foreseeable future, there will always be functionality that I can add to this project and new technologies that I'd like to experiment with. As such, I will maintain the following lists to give some indication of what I'm trying to achieve at any given time.

**I'm working on**
- Add automated reporting functionality using RabbitMQ, Postgres and Python.

**I might work on**
- Adding a dynamic reporting interface by attaching a front-end.
- Improving the automated submissions so that the process can function correctly even if it doesn't execute each day.
- Developing with TDD.

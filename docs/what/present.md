# What am I working on now?

## In short

* Building further reporting views.
* Refactor (using TDD) the expenditure script.

## In more detail

### Building further reporting views.

I have built some simple reporting views to give me an idea of what I've spent so far this week and month. I'd like to extend these to include past months and account in some way for predictable spending and income (rent, salary, etc).

### Refactor the expenditure script.

I would like to trial TDD for sake of learning more about testing. The expenditure scripts are in need of a refactor and so they seem a good candidate for experimentation.

## In short

* Deploying on AWS.

## In more detail

### Deploying on AWS.

I would like to host my project externally so that it can be up constantly (something that is convenient now but will become essential as the project grows).

Amazon offers a cloud computing service called EC2 as part of its AWS suite. This is a good solution for me because it offers everything I require at the moment and has a free tier. This gives me the opportunity to grow my project.

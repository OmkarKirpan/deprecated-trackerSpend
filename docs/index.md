# Welcome to trackerSpend

Hello, and welcome to trackerSpend; an environment in which I can have a play
 with new technologies under the (arguably false) pretense that I'm building
 something useful.

Really though, I'm working on a tool that helps me understand my finances.
Exactly what that means is difficult to define since it's still taking shape
but so long as I'm learning and not running out of money, I'll consider this
project a success.

## My approach

For the foreseeable future, there's going to be a whole range of things that
 I want to mess around with and functionality that I want to add. To get a
  quick insight into what I'm building and why, check out the following pages.

* What do I hope to build in the [future](what/future.md)?
* What am I building [now](what/present.md)?
* What have I built in the [past](what/past.md)?
